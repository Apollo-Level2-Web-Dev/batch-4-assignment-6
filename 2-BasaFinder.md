# BasaFinder üè° (Smart Rental & Housing Solution) B4A6V2

# **Project Overview**

## **Purpose:**

BasaFinder is a full-stack web application that provides a smart rental housing solution. The platform connects landlords, tenants, and an admin who oversees both users and house listings. Landlords can post and manage rental property listings, while tenants can search for, view, and request rentals. When a landlord approves a rental request, a payment option becomes available to the tenant, and the landlord can provide their phone number for further contact.

## **Key Components:**

### **Roles:**

-   -   **Admin:** Manages all users(Landlords, Tenants) accounts and rental house posts.
    -   **Landlord:** Posts and manages their rental listings, reviews and responds to rental requests.
    -   **Tenant:** Searches for rental houses and submits requests to rent.

### **Security:**

-   -   Custom authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).
    -   Password hashing using bcrypt for secure storage.
    -   Role-based access control to ensure only authorized access to private pages.

----------

### Core Functionalities:

-   -   **Rental House Listings:** Landlords can post detailed rental listings with `rental house location`, `details description`, `rent amount`, `number of bedrooms`, `multiple images`, `landlord ID (to link with the users collection)` and any other necessary details.
    -   **Search & Filter:** Tenants can search rentals by `location`, `price` and `number of bedrooms`.
    -   **Rental Requests:** Tenants can submit rental requests. Landlords can approve/reject them.
    -   **Payment:** When a landlord approves a rental request, a payment option (Stripe, ShurjoPay, etc) is made available on the tenant‚Äôs end to secure the rental.
    -   **Role-Based Dashboards:** Custom dashboards for **Admin**, **Landlords** and **Tenants**.
    -   **Email Notifications:** Automatic updates for rental requests.
